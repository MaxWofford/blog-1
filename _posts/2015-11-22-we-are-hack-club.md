We're going to keep our first post nice and simple. As of today, we're changing
our name from hackEDU to Hack Club.

We decided to make this change because we think Hack Club better reflects the
nature of our work (we help people start Hack Clubs) and it's easier to share
with people.

In addition to the new name, @MaxWofford made some really swanky stickers that
we'll be putting on sale soon. We're also launching a Teespring for a really
neat-o shirt that @MaxWofford crafted over the weekend.

Happy hacking!
