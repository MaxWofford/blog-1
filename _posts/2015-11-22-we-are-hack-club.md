We're going to keep our first post nice and simple. As of today, we're changing
our name from hackEDU to Hack Club.

What does this mean for you? Well, not much. Now you'll find our website at
<https://hackclub.io> instead of <https://hackedu.us> and our other online
profiles have been renamed as well.

We decided to make this change because we think Hack Club better reflects the
nature of our work (we help people start Hack Clubs) and it's easier to share
with people.

In addition to the new name, [Max](http://maxwofford.com/) made a pretty neat
GIF and some really swanky stickers.

If you'd like to get your hands the stickers below, just click on the sticker
you're interested in and you'll be brought to a page where you can buy it.

Happy hacking!
