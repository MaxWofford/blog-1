We're very excited to announce Hack Camp, our two-week high school summer camp
in downtown San Francisco, will be coming back this summer. There'll be four
sessions starting June 6th and ending August 19th. It's targeted towards
complete beginners and we'll be covering the fundamentals of web development
(i.e. building websites and web games). Find out more and apply at
[https://camp.hackclub.com/](https://camp.hackclub.com/).

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out! We can be
contacted at [summer@hackclub.com](mailto:summer@hackclub.com).
