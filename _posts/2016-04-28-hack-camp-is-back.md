summary:    We'll be running a Hack Camp this summer.
---

We're very excited to announce Hack Camp, our two-week high school summer camp
in downtown San Francisco, will be coming back this summer.

There will be four sessions starting June 6th and ending August 19th. It's
targeted towards complete beginners and we'll be covering the fundamentals of
web development (i.e. building websites and web games). Find out more and apply
at [https://camp.hackclub.com/](https://camp.hackclub.com/).

I could go on all day about how much of a blast it was last summer, but I
figured last year's hackers can talk about it better than I can.

> I felt euphoric at the end of each day because I had managed to implement a
> feature I had previously thought impossible to implement. It really taught me
> that I could 'distort reality' and make things HAPPEN.

> The way Hack Camp is taught is totally opposite of what our school system is.
> This camp really opened my mind to the different ways that I can learn.

>  In the camp's mere two weeks, more than in any part of my life, not in my
>  days as a fetus, an infant, a toddler, an elementary schooler, a middle
>  schooler, a high school freshman, a high school sophomore, or a high school
>  junior, I have never made so many mistakes.
